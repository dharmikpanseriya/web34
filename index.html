        <h1>Supertrend Indicator</h1>
    </div>

    <p>The Super Trend Indicator (STI) is a versatile and widely-used tool in the realm of technical analysis. Designed to capture the essence of a prevailing trend, the STI assists traders in determining the primary direction of the market, helping them make more informed decisions about their trades.</p>
    <h3>What it is and what it shows</h3>
    <p>The Super Trend Indicator, typically visualized as a line on a chart, works by utilizing the Average True Range (ATR) in its calculations, and it adjusts itself based on the volatility of the underlying asset.</p>
    <p>Key features of the Super Trend Indicator:</p>
    <p><b>Directional Clarity:</b> The STI provides clear buy and sell signals. When the price is above the Super Trend line and the line is green, it indicates a bullish trend. Conversely, when the price is below the line and the line is red, it suggests a bearish trend.</p>
    <p><b>Adaptable to Volatility:</b> By using the ATR in its formulation, the Super Trend Indicator is sensitive to price volatility, allowing it to adjust dynamically.</p>
    <p><b>Simplicity:</b> One of the primary appeals of the STI is its simplicity. It offers a straightforward visualization of the trend without the complexity of some other indicators.</p>
    <h3>How to trade it</h3>
    <p>When utilizing the Super Trend Indicator, consider the following guidelines:</p>
    <p><b>Entry Points:</b> A buy signal is generated when the Super Trend line turns green and is positioned below the price. A sell signal arises when the line turns red and is above the price.</p>
    <p><b>Exit Points:</b> Traders may consider closing their positions when the STI changes color, signaling a potential reversal in trend.</p>
    <p><b>Stop Loss:</b> The Super Trend line can be used as a stop loss level. For a long position, a trader can set the stop loss just below the Super Trend line. For a short position, the stop loss can be set just above it.</p>
    <p><b>Combining with Other Indicators:</b> To increase the reliability of the signals, combine the STI with other technical indicators like moving averages or momentum oscillators.</p>
    <p>For example, in a chart where the STI turns from red to green and moves below the price, traders might consider this a favorable point to enter a long position. If used alongside a momentum oscillator that shows an overbought condition, traders might proceed with caution or wait for further confirmation.</p>
